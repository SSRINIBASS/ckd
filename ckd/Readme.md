# Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction

This project uses a Random Forest Classifier to predict Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) with ~98% accuracy, based on the Kaggle dataset.

## Files

- `train_model.py`: Trains and saves the model.
- `predict.py`: Loads the model and predicts on new data or the dataset.
- `kidney_disease.csv`: Dataset .
- `.pkl` files: Pre-trained model and preprocessing objects.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `joblib`
    Install with: `pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn joblib`

## Setup
